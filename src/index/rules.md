# Rules

In order to assist us in creating a relaxed, fun, safe and non-sectarian environment, some rules are necessary.

RULES:

1. We have zero tolerance for Racism, Sexism, Transphobia, Homophobia, and Ableism. All racist and sexist slurs are banned. Messages containing slurs or banned words will be deleted and you will be warned. Repeat offenders and people who defend their use of discriminatory language will be indefinitely banned. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All applicably sexist and racist slurs are banned and have benefit of the doubt against any &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible permitted usage, that is, a rare word considered to be a sexist slur will automatically &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be banned and would need to justified against. Messages containing banned terms will be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deleted and you will be warned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically Banned Words:
- Cunt
- Bitch
- Whore
- Ree (As in the meme)
- Retard
- Spastic
- The N Word

2. Maintain a PG13 Environment at all times. AusSoc is an inclusive political and social space. Posting explicit or sexual content bars people from participating in the server and in the context of an internet culture dominated by young men can open the space for sexism. Those who violate this rule will have their posts deleted and be warned, while repeat offenders will be indefinitely banned. 
3. Disagreements should be managed in a comradely manner, and we have a zero tolerance policy for abusive behaviour against other members of this community. People who abuse others will be put in a cool off zone and warned. Repeated offenders may be banned. Do not make your situation worse by abusing mods for enforcing this rule. 

4. No support or apology for violence or repression against the working class and the left, including, but not limited to support for repression by the Eastern Bloc states, and support for the policies of the Australian Labor Party. Jokes pertaining to Gulags and the murder of leftists are banned.
5. Do not leak or share information from this server on other discord servers or anywhere else on the internet. This is for security reasons and is taken extremely seriously by the mods. Posting screenies from this server to other servers is particularly prohibited. Depending on the severity of the leak, people who violate this rule may receive a warning or a ban. 

6. Do not use alts, or alternative accounts, to try to get into this server. It is anti-social/creepy to pretend to be someone else in a server like AusSoc, particularly if you are subject to a temporary ban. People caught using alts in this server will be indefinitely banned. 

7. Do not block server moderators and admins. They need to be able to do their jobs. Do not ignore them either when they are telling you not to do something or you may be put in time out.

8. Avoid spam. Repeated posting of spam will result in a timeout.

9. Do not advocate violence in this server against groups or individuals under any circumstances.

10. This space is not a replacement for mental or physical health support, while we aim to be a place of solidarity, we have to forbid discussions of suicide and self-harm. Please understand that this was a difficult decision to make, and we appreciate your understanding.
