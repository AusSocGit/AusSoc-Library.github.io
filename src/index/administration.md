 If you think the mod team has done something wrong, isn't taking up an issue, if there needs to be a change to the rules, or anything else related to server administration then #hundred-flowers is the place to express and discuss it. You are welcome to raise anything within #hundrer-flowers but if you want annonymity you are also welcome to dm anyone on the mod team.
